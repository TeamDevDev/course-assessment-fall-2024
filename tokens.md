# Token Use Template

## Introduction

If you are a student in Computer Science 203 (Software Engineering), you may use
this template to request that the course instructor re-assess your work by
agreeing to "pay" one of the **three tokens** that you were given at the start
of the semester. You must adhere to these regulations when using this form to
submit a request for your work to be reassessed by "paying" a token.

You should use the template content in this form to **create an issue** in this
GitHub repository. After creating the issue you should **send a link to the
issue to the course instructor through a direct message on Discord**. Any
student who submits this form is declaring that they have read and agree with
all of the following regulations for using a token to request re-assessment of
their work in this course. Please do not submit this form until you have
carefully read and understood all of the points in the form.

## Token Use Regulations

1) Each student starts out with a total of three (3) tokens when the academic
semester starts. Students can only submit this form if they have at least one
token that they can "spend" in order to "pay for" the reassessment of their
work.

2) Students who submit this form more than one time will have their requests
processed in the order in which they were submitted. This means that an earlier
request for the "spending" of a token will be granted before a follow-on request
for spending a token. Any later requests for spending a token will not be
granted if the earlier requests for the use of a token were already processed.

3) Students who submit this form to pay a token must include the exact URL of
the GitHub repository for which they want to regain access and complete
additional work. Failure to submit the correct URL of the GitHub repository, as
seen in your web browser when using the GitHub web interface, will result in the
spending of a token without the benefit of receiving any reassessment
opportunity. Students should not fill out this form without including a valid
URL that points to the GitHub repository that contains the work for which they
are requesting reassessment through the "spending" of a token. This is an
example of a correct URL of a GitHub repository:
`https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-203-F2024/computer-science-203-fall-2024-executable-examination-one-gkapfham`.
Please note that you will not be able to click on and access the contents of
this repository because it is private and thus not accessible to students in the
course. Again, students who do not provide a correct URL to a GitHub repository
will have their issue closed and their token spent.

4) Students who complete this form so that they can "pay" a token for the
opportunity to work on a module reflection repository acknowledge that they
cannot cite the work that they completed in a team-based fashion during a
different module of the course. Students may also not use a token to pay to
revise a blog post that they wrote in a team-based fashion.

5) Students who complete this form so that they can "pay" a token to finish
missing work for a project must bear in mind that they must abide by the
specific rules for that assignment as they work on it. For instance, this means
that students are still responsible for citing their sources and upholding the
Allegheny College Honor Code when they are revising their assignment. Finally,
the use of a token to regain access to an assignment repository will unlock the
repository for one week at which time the course instructor reserves the right
to again lock the repository.

6) The last day by which a student in CMPSC 203 can submit revised work for
re-assessment is December 6, 2024 at 11:59 PM. Unless there is documented
evidence of an extenuating circumstance that prevents the completion of work by
this deadline, no course materials intended for re-assessment may be submitted
beyond this point. Moreover, no requests for re-assessment will be granted if
the student does not have any remaining tokens and they do not have documented
evidence of an extenuating circumstance that prevented the completion of their
work by a set deadline for a project or an assessment.

7) Students who plan to resubmit work according to these guidelines should do so
through using this template to create an issue in this GitHub repository and
then with direct message on Discord that links to the issue to request the
re-assessment of their work. Students should again bear in mind that, once the
academic semester ends and the deadline for re-submission has passed, the course
instructor will not grant students the opportunity to use tokens to "pay" for a
reassessment.

8) The course instructor uses GitHub and GitHub Classroom to disable push access
to repositories and/or disable the creation of project repositories once the
deadline for a project has passed. Students must remember that the only
repository that they can use to submit work for a specific assessment is the one
that they created through the use of GitHub Classroom. Importantly, this means
that the course instructor will not directly assess work through a public GitHub
repository that contains, for instance, the content of the course web site or
the source code of a long-term course project.

9) Students who use this template to request the re-assessment of their work
understand that any modification to a grade that the course instructor already
assigned is done so at the discretion of the course instructor and not subject
to additional review unless new information is submitted by the student.
Students must also use this template to request that the instructor take a
single action for the "payment" of a single token; requests for multiple actions
require multiple completions of the template and the payment of multiple tokens.

10) Students who use this template to request the re-assessment of their work
understand that they may not use it to request a re-assessment of the final
executable examination in the Software Engineering course.
